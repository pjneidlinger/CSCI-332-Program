        The main function of the router is to broadcast internet signal, and allow other devices to access the internet.<br /><br />

        The far left yellow port is the port that has incoming signal from a modem. The next four ports are ports for 
        outgoing signal to allow devices to access the internet. The final port on the far right is the power port that
        allows the router to have power.<br /><br />

        The model of my router at home is the TP-Link N450 router. It stands upright, so it looks differently as compared
        to the lab router that lays flat. Also, my router from home has a higher data rate than the one from the lab, as
        it supports up to 450Mbps as opposed to the 300Mbps from the lab.<br /><br />
