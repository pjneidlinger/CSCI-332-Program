        <h1>Introduction</h1><br />
        The goal and motivation of this lab is for us students to become more familiar with all of the network equipment in the lab.
        In doing this, we will become more comfortable with the equipment, and less confused about how the internet works around us.
        Our expectation for this lab is to have a greater understanding of the network, and the network equipment.<br /><br />
        In the AH208 Lab, there are 25 computers, 2 routers, and 10 switches.<br /><br />
        In the Network Interface Card section, we delve into the specifics of the network interface cards that are included in lab
        computers. Also, protocols that are supported, and specifications of the network interface cards are described.<br /><br />
        In the Router section, we delve into the purpose of the routers that are installed in the lab. Along with this, we include a 
        picture of the router, and a description of the specifications of the router. We also include the router's user manual.<br /><br />
        In the Computer section, we describe the specifics of the computers that are in the AH208 Lab. We also list the computer's
        technical specifications, and include a link to the computer's user manual.<br /><br />
        In the Cable section, multiple things are covered. We describe the makeup of the cables, along with the color coding of
        the cables. We also include pictures of the cables that we created.<br /><br />
