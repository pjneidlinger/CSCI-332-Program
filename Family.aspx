    <center><h1>My Family</h1></center><br /><hr />
    My immediate family consists of 5 people including me. My dad's name is 
    Phillip Neidlinger, and he and I have the same name, which is why I go by
    PJ, to avoid confusion. My dad recently turned 50 in September. My mom's 
    name is Shana Neidlinger, and she's my ultimate role model. I am the oldest
    sibling of three children, and I have a little brother and a little sister.
    My brother's name is Lucas Neidlinger, and he is a senior in high school at
    my alma mater, Spartanburg Christian Academy. My sister's name is Grace
    Neidlinger, and she is an eighth grader at Boiling Springs Intermediate School.
