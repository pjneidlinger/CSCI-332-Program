# CSCI-332-Program
This is a repository for my CSCI 332 program that I am submitting as part of my Senior Portfolio.

### Program Information
This program is called Personal Website, and is a compilation of an entire semester's work, up until the point of submission of the Senior Project, in CSCI 332. This website houses our work for the first seven labs of the semester, and includes work from disciplines of HTML coding, CSS work, and VB.net programming. I have included the correct file header in my website default.aspx page, as that is the home page for the website.

### How To Compile/Run
This program was created and run through Visual Studio 2015, and was run on a machine running Windows Server 2012. I have included the entire set of source code, along with the Visual Studio solution as a release. Opening the solution in Visual Studio should allow a user to view my website and all my lab data.
