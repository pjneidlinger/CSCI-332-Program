    My name is PJ Neidlinger, and I am a junior Computer Science major at CSU.
    My name is an acronym that stands for Phillip Jerome, and my full name is 
    Phillip Jerome Neidlinger II. I have two siblings, a little brother and a little
    sister, and their names are Lucas and Grace. My hobbies include playing sports
    like basketball, football, and tennis, along with watching professional sports
    of the same type. I am an avid Oklahoma City Thunder fan, I like the Carolina
    Panthers, and I am a Carolina Gamecocks fan also. I also enjoy working on cars 
    and working on computers.
