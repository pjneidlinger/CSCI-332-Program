        <h1>Task 1 Section 2.2</h1>
        After we connected computers to the router, we then adjusted the TCP/IP settings.
        We did this by going into the Network and Sharing Center, clicked on Advanced Settings,
        double clicked on the Ethernet connection, and then clicked on Properties.
        We then adjusted the IP Address option, and changed PJ's IP to be 192.168.0.2, and changed
        Leroy's IP to be 192.168.0.3. We also changed both Subnet Masks to be 255.255.255.0.
        After changing these settings, we clicked ok, and then both rebooted our computers.
        We then changed the Workgroup settings by going into the Start Menu, right clicking on
        This PC, and then clicking on Change Settings. We named the Workgroup APPLIEDNETWORK, and
        we changed PJ's PC name to be PJ, and Leroy's PC name to be Leroy.
