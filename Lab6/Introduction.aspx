        <h1>Introduction</h1><br />
        The goal and motivation of the project is for both of us students to be able to setup and understand a
        local area network with either one or two routers. Along with this, we should be able to set up the 
        protocol and Workgroup settings, and be able to transfer files between two computers on a LAN.<br /><br />
        In the AH208 Lab, there are 25 computers, 2 routers, and 10 switches.<br /><br />
        In the Task 1 Section, we break up the process into four parts. We first describe how to set up
        a LAN with one router, then we describe how to set up the IP/TCP protocol, then we describe how
        to share a file over a local area network, and then we describe a speed test we did over our LAN.<br /><br />
        In the Task 2 Section, we break up the process into three parts. We first describe how to set up a LAN
        using two routers, then we describe how to share a file over a local area network, then we describe a speed
        test we did over our LAN.<br /><br />
        In the Experiment Log section, we give a description of when we worked on the project. We also describe who did what part
        of the lab. <br /><br />
