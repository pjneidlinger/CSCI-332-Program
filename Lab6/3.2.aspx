        We shared the file by first creating a folder in the C Directory named Public. After creating the folder,
        we right clicked on the folder, and selected properties. We the chose the Sharing tab, and then chose
        the Share option. In the share menu, we chose Everyone from the list, and then selected add. We then
        selected the arrow dropdown, and allowed everyone to have read/write access. After we did this, the file
