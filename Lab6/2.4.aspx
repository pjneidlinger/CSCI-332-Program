        <h1>Task 1 Section 2.4</h1>
        To conduct our experiment, we first had to create a folder that was greater than 4 gigabytes.
        We downloaded a Youtube Video of an incredible song, and we then copied the song over 1300
        times, ending with a final folder size of 4.10 gigabytes. We then went onto the other computer
        on the Local Area Network, and we copied the file to the desktop of that computer. The overall
        file size was 4.10 gigabytes, and it took 7 minutes and 20 seconds to copy, so a transmission 
        speed of 7 minutes and 20 seconds, and the average data rate was roughly 9.5MBps, or 
        76,000,000bps.
