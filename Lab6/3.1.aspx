        <h1>Task 2 Section 3.1</h1>
        To set up the Local Area Connection with two routers, we first made sure we had the right
        equipment. We obtained three of our ethernet cables from Lab4, our two school-issued laptops,
        and our two school-issued routers. We first connected one end of one ethernet cable into
        PJ's computer. We then connected the other end of that ethernet cable into port two of PJ's 
        router. We then connected another ethernet cable into port one of PJ's router, and connected the
        other end of the cable into Port one of Leroy's router. We then connected one end a third ethernet
        cable into port two of Leroy's router, and connected the other end into Leroy's computer.
        Also, we used the exact same LAN settings from the one router setup, with the same IP Addresses,
        the same Workgroup settings, and the same adapter settings.
